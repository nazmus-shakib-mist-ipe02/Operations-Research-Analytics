    "You are doing the resource planning for a lawn furniture company. They manufacture decorative sets of legs for lawn chairs, benches, and tables from metal tubes using a two step process involving tube-bending, and welding. The profit the company receives from the sale of each product is $3 for a set of chair legs, $3 for a set of bench legs, and $5 for a set of table legs. You are trying to plan the production mix for the upcoming season. Unfortunately, due to a strike there is only 2000 lbs tubing available for production on-hand.\n",
